### Reflections

#### Review & Familiarization

This week was mostly a "Get to know Rhino and Grasshopper a little better" week. 

I encountered an issue with Rhino where I suddenly couldn't select any of my objects. This mystified myself as well as some other students, but after assistance from all three instructors, we found out that my Default layer had somehow become locked! This made it as to where I couldn't select or drag any objects I had baked onto that layer. I'm not sure how it became locked, but it's something that I look out for now.

In class last week, Dr. Sudhu demonstrated how to use the laser cutters and gave some good advice on how to move the laser cutter around our material. This was a very helpful demonstration that made the concept a bit less intimidating. Now I would like to experiment more with the 3D printers.

I also found TJ's ["Computational Design: Worked Example"](https://youtu.be/GHtWNAPiAoE) video very helpful. I had never heard of the term "computational design" before, but applying that term to the type of 3D modeling that Rhino does made it a lot more clear. I'm used to programs like Maya and Blender, which also have computational design elements, but are a little more freeform in their style of 3D modeling and animating. Thinking about modeling from a mathematical perspective is very interesting and something I had never considered before, since I usually just kind of "go with the flow" and consider it a very tactile experience. 

Otherwise, I have scheduled an appointment to use the laser cutters and will also take additional 3D printing trainings so that I can experiment a little more and improve my in-class design. 

#### Speculations

Rhino could be very helpful for some of my other class projects. I could see myself utilizing the 2D laser cut patterns for my Studio Foundations potted plant design. It might also be helpful for printing out robotic parts, although my robotics knowledge is severely lacking. Right now I just need to come up with some more modifications to personalize the phone stand. I am a bit nervous to mess it all up, but I've re-started the project files so many times now that I'm kind of past the initial fear.

I wonder how thin vs. thick the materials should be if I like the end result to be cylindrical (for laser cutting). Maybe I can score the wood or other material after?)

#### TLDR;

Not a ton of updates, mostly just increasing my familiarity with the program and watching a lot of tutorials. More exciting pictures incoming next week as I modify and print my design!
