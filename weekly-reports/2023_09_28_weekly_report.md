### Reflections

#### Class Recap

On Thursday the 21st, we did a little more exploration with the Photon 2 controllers. I had already done some of the examples from the [homework tutorials](https://github.com/loopstick/Photon2_Tutorial/blob/main/README.md) but paused once I had to use the breadboard. I'm glad that I did, because the instructors had some very good advice during the session and without it, I might have messed up my laptop or microcontroller.

For example, I should always have some layer between the microcontroller and my laptop, like the foam or the breadboard. I should not place the microcontroller directly on top of my laptop. It seems like simple advice and common sense, but I hadn't really thought about it. While the microcontroller is running, it can fry the top of your laptop. So that's really good to know!!

I also learned some new electronics vocabulary.

- Pins: the little metal circles where you connect wires onto the microcontroller.
- Breadboard: A small (usually plastic) device used to help connect wires and other electronics to your microcontroller. It has a layer of copper inside for the electric current between objects. Everything can be easily moved around, so it's not usually used for permanent construction (just prototyping).
- Resistor: A little device that helps ground the electric current. They are color coded.

Here are some images and GIFs of me completing the rest of the tutorials. I also completed the sensor tutorial, but we had to disassemble very quickly so I forgot to take pictures. :(

This is the Photon2 running the "Blink LED" tutorial. I then modified the script to make the external and internal LEDs blink at the same time.
