### Reflections

We did a lot this week! After receiving some feedback from Shm on our initial "CleanTech" idea, we decided to pivot and just focus on designing a system of Photons that could communicate with one another. The final product would then emerge out of that.

Our re-designed concept: Ghosty, the Hot/Cold game! Ghosty is a little ghost that is scared of the light. When the lights are on, it'll run away until it finds a dark place to hide. Using your "ghost catcher" tool, you play a game of Hot/Cold to see how close you are to Ghosty and catch it!

We created a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/iTPrt7UdsSuKgONyTlIzIG/Wipey%3A-TDF-Project-2?type=design&node-id=7%3A2&mode=design&t=EmpagBOGm7JHa7A0-1) to keep track of our design process. 

First, we decided to experiment with the Photons and see if we could even get some motion happening. On Shm's recommendation, we followed the [Accelerometer --> Servo tutorial](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-equilet/blob/main/project_demonstrables/particle_workbench/accel_to_servo/README.md). 

When you tilt the accelerometer (which is attached to the breadboard), it changes the direction and speed of the Servo motor. Our biggest challenges were just learning what kind of functions to call upon from the in-built Servo library. However, we were successful and managed to get the motor going!
