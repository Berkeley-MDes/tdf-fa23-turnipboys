# Report #7 - Week of 10/12/2023

### Reflections

We did a lot this week! After receiving some feedback from Shm on our initial "CleanTech" idea, we decided to pivot and just focus on designing a system of Photons that could communicate with one another. The final product would then emerge out of that.

Our re-designed concept: Ghosty, the Hot/Cold game! Ghosty is a little ghost that is scared of the light. When the lights are on, it'll run away until it finds a dark place to hide. Using your "ghost catcher" tool, you play a game of Hot/Cold to see how close you are to Ghosty and catch it!



### Speculations
