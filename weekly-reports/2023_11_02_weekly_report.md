### Reflections

After an insightful presentation/Q&A session with Pete from ZeroWidth as well as some communication with him over Slack and email, I thought that I would try my hand at calling the ZeroWidth API through my own website.

I have website development experience, but something about this felt especially intimidating to me because I've never designed/written code for any kind of chatbot before and I don't think that I've ever actually called an API in a website before. My web dev experience is mostly just HTML/CSS/Javascript stuff for simple UI work and then implementing/embedding multimedia into the website. So this would definitely be a challenge for me, although I felt okay about approaching it in the time that I had. I guess by the end of this report we'll see if I have actually done it!

In the meantime, I realized that the way that I formatted the information for the AI's knowledge set was just...not very good at all. The AI needed much more clarity and didn't have any kind of inherent context or understanding about what I was giving it, so I knew that I would have to do a little more re-formatting and editing to make it more clear. It was especially challenging that my portfolio and LinkedIn sites are pretty out of date, so a lot of information about my recent projects isn't even already available. I had to write up a few keywords and phrases about my projects and explicitly state that they were recent projects and the AI should refer to them when asked.

I also added a new welcome message from the bot. I know that the bot cannot store information between chat sessions, but I'm curious to know what it can actively do within the chat session. So I wanted to experiment more with crafting functions. Since the AI is modeled on ChatGPT, it cannot send or take in images, which I was disappointed about. My main goal of creating a custom site for the AI to answer questions is just to see if I can create an animated avatar for the AI and make it a little more interesting when users are talking to it.

The AI also overuses a lot of the key phrases I gave it, so I have just been trying to polish up its vocabulary and speech patterns by carefully selecting the wording and instructions that I give it. It's a lot more challenging than I thought it would be and mostly a lot of manual work.
