# Report #8 - Week of 10/19/2023

### Reflections

Last Thursday's class period was a work session, so my group received some additional feedback from Shm on how to trim down extra features and prioritize the two Photons communicating with one another. We also wanted to make sure we could get more than one wheel operating, but soon realized that there wasn't enough power being diverted to both motors.

With guidance from Dr. Sudhu, we observed a soldering demo and learned that we needed to use the featherboard to divert the power between the motors. This also fixed some errors that we were received with the photoresistor (the light values kept on varying wildly in ways that seemed very incorrect).

Figuring out the publisher/subscriber communication between the Photons was our biggest challenge. I initially tackled it, then we adapted TJ's tutorial demo to our purposes. We needed some more help from the instructors, but finally got it operational, which I am so happy about! I fell ill this week (I think that Berkeley air is not good for me...this keeps on happening??? Why am I always sick??) so I mostly worked on debugging and helping my groupmates figure out the Particle IDE stuff. 

Initially, Christine had printed out some 3D modeled wheels, but they weren't very stable. We decided to use some wheels she got from a kit (or maybe the free items section in the Makerspace). She also cut out a very cute lasercut design for the baseboard.

I also did a lot of records tracking and planned out the script and shots for our final video. I also created the hunter device box (very simple) and did some final debugging to help with the OLED messages (some minor formatting things to get each word printed on a new line and to change with the input, etc.). 

We were so so happy that the robot moved around and worked in the end, even if it wasn't exactly as we wanted it to be. Ankur and I filmed and edited the final video. You can watch more about how the robot works and the design process there.

### Speculations

I wrote the speculations out for the video, but to expand out a bit more here: This technology already exists and is utilized in a lot of different ways, but I think that could be really fun to implement in the "at-home" gaming and entertainment industry. I loved how on the Nintendogs DS game you could blow on the microphone to dry off your dogs and play with them or tell them commands. I think that utilizing other interesting and different forms of sensor input could provide an opportunity for exciting and new styles of gameplay. They're just not very commonplace now, but they could be!

This was a pretty short report because most of it is covered in the video and I am very sick. But I am so happy with what we created and I learned a lot! I've never done any kind of electronics work like this before, so it was very interesting. The ghost theme has also put me in a very spooky mood. >:)
