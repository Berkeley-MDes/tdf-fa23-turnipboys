# Report #3 - Week of 9/14/2023

## Aylish Turner

### Reflection

#### Lost in the Sauce...

I already typed out this entire report once and I forgot to commit my changes so I am not pleased with that...such is life...

Most of this week was spent procrastinating and dreading the final deliverable because I honestly wasn't sure about what I wanted to do. I wanted to customize my phone stand to be very personal and fun, but experimenting with Rhino and Grasshopper was very difficult for me since I am still very new to the software.

I think that I've grown a lot and already improved my knowledge quite a bit (especially considering I had never even heard of Rhino/Grasshopper before we downloaded it), but I was worried that my skills weren't enough to really power through the project and turn in something interesting.

I finally decided to just sit down and try something out, which was extremely difficult but definitely a good learning experience.

#### Restrictions

I wanted to start a new project, completely fresh. This was very very scary to me and a part of why I kept putting it off - I wasn't really confident in my skills and prioritized other projects I knew I could be somewhat successful in. 

I prioritized just learning as much as I could and trying to showcase what knowledge I did gain in the process, even if the final product was pretty bad in the end and I ended up switching gears entirely.

My goals:

- Create a custom phone stand using Rhino and Grasshopper.
- 3D print the phone stand (my first time using a 3D printer).
- Optimize the phone stand for vertical orientation; useful for video calls, filming, and mindless Reddit scrolling (lol).

#### Inspiration

I thought that it would be very funny to create a phone stand modeled around *2001: A Space Odyssey.* My phone would be the monolith with an ape on one side and a bone on the other.

#### Design

My phone would be completely vertical, which is an unusual position for a phone stand but useful for my filming purposes. It also emulates the monolith better, which is my primary goal.

I initially planned for the phone stand to be quite wide and thin, with enough support to hold the phone up vertical. I also considered leaving room for a charger wire on the bottom, but that would make the stand very tall and I didn't really want that, so I later scrapped it. I wanted the phone to seem tall and foreboding rather than it looking like a bunch of tall rocks stacked on top of each other.

#### Process

I was honestly having so much trouble with this. I thought that I had a decent grasp of Grasshopper basics but nothing I did really seemed to work. My objects wouldn't cap properly (or so it seemed) and I was running on very little sleep, so nothing made sense to me. I fell rather ill this week but it was already so close to the submission period that I figured I just had to push through for the sake of finishing something.

My first attempt at constructing just some basic cylinders stacked on top of each other as a basic stand bottom.

But when I uploaded my baked & exported model to Sketchfab, it was just the cylinders???? They were not solids???? Something went wrong here in my exporting process...

I made a little bit of progress with my cylinders and managed to fix the cap issue (not even sure what happened with the first attempt), but I was struggling with the solid difference component. I followed TJ's directions from his tutorial video and watched many videos online, but I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. I think that I'm missing some kind of vital step about the breps or some plane or something at the start of my Grasshopper file, but I will need to ask for extra assistance to figure it out.

#### Issues

Nearing the wire, it came down to a combination of factors, but mostly a really big one:

- I became really, really sick. It began at the start of the week and it might have just been stress or maybe I caught something, but I was super exhausted all of the time and really quite ill. I knew that this would just have to be my "Level 1" project due to the circumstances, and I'm okay with that (but still disappointed).

#### Putting a Pin in It

Here is my collection of resources because I REALLY want to continue finishing this. Maybe in the next couple of weeks I can just turn it into a personal project. I don't even like *2001* that much. I just really want to complete this because it was an interesting challenge and I know that once my brain is all healed & rested I can definitely do it!
