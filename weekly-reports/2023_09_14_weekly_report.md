# Report #3 - Week of 9/14/2023

### Reflection

#### Lost in the Sauce...

I already typed out this entire report once and I forgot to commit my changes so I am not pleased with that...such is life...

Most of this week was spent procrastinating and dreading the final deliverable because I honestly wasn't sure about what I wanted to do. I wanted to customize my phone stand to be very personal and fun, but experimenting with Rhino and Grasshopper was very difficult for me since I am still very new to the software.

I think that I've grown a lot and already improved my knowledge quite a bit (especially considering I had never even heard of Rhino/Grasshopper before we downloaded it), but I was worried that my skills weren't enough to really power through the project and turn in something interesting.

I finally decided to just sit down and try something out, which was extremely difficult but definitely a good learning experience.

#### Restrictions

I wanted to start a new project, completely fresh. This was very very scary to me and a part of why I kept putting it off - I wasn't really confident in my skills and prioritized other projects I knew I could be somewhat successful in. 

I prioritized just learning as much as I could and trying to showcase what knowledge I did gain in the process, even if the final product was pretty bad in the end.

My goals:

- Create a custom phone stand using Rhino and Grasshopper.
- 3D print the phone stand (my first time using a 3D printer).
- Optimize the phone stand for vertical orientation; useful for video calls, filming, and mindless Reddit scrolling (lol).

#### Inspiration

I thought that it would be very funny to create a phone stand modeled around *2001: A Space Odyssey.* My phone would be the monolith with an ape on one side and a bone on the other.

#### Design

My phone would be completely vertical, which is an unusual position for a phone stand but useful for my filming purposes. It also emulates the monolith better, which is my primary goal.

I initially planned for the phone stand to be quite wide and thin, with enough support to hold the phone up vertical. I also considered leaving room for a charger wire on the bottom, but that would make the stand very tall and I didn't really want that, so I later scrapped it. I wanted the phone to seem tall and foreboding rather than it looking like a bunch of tall rocks stacked on top of each other.
