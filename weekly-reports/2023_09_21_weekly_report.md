### Reflections

#### Class Recap

I was so happy to turn in my phone stand on Thursday and then be done with the first project after submitting my PDF on Monday. I enjoyed the process, but it was a lot of mental labor. I'm very curious to learn what we'll be doing in this second project.

Also on Monday, Jeff gave a very interesting lecture on microcontrollers and the Digital Ecosystem. I was already familiar with the term "digital ecosystem" (which I had actually learned about in an art class!), but my knowledge on microcontrollers is far more limited. I've worked with a Raspberry Pi before and just did very very simple things many years ago. I don't know much about electronics, wires, and all of this other stuff, so I'm genuinely very excited to learn more about it. It makes me feel like a mad scientist. :P

#### Homework - Photon2 Tutorial

I set up my Particle account. Note: I must use the Google Chrome browser to run the Particle setup (does not work with Firefox).

### Speculations
