### Reflections

#### Class Recap

I was so happy to turn in my phone stand on Thursday and then be done with the first project after submitting my PDF on Monday. I enjoyed the process, but it was a lot of mental labor. I'm very curious to learn what we'll be doing in this second project.

Also on Monday, Jeff gave a very interesting lecture on microcontrollers and the Digital Ecosystem. I was already familiar with the term "digital ecosystem" (which I had actually learned about in an art class!), but my knowledge on microcontrollers is far more limited. I've worked with a Raspberry Pi before and just did very very simple things many years ago. I don't know much about electronics, wires, and all of this other stuff, so I'm genuinely very excited to learn more about it. It makes me feel like a mad scientist. :P

#### Homework - Photon2 Tutorial

I set up my Particle account. Note: I must use the Google Chrome browser to run the Particle setup (does not work with Firefox).

I connected my P2 device to my computer. It then installed Device OS onto my P2. In order to do this, it put the P2 into Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) mode. This made the P2 start rapidly blinking with a green light (the blue light remained on). As it was updating, the light began blinking at different rates in different colors.

On the "Organize your Particle device" page, it told me to select an existing organization and product for my device. My only organization available was my "Personal Sandbox," so I selected that. I didn't have any products available, so I created a new one and named it Baby Worm Photon 2 / P2s (this is because my laptop is called "Worm"). The name is baby_worm :)

I then connected my baby_worm to the Wi-Fi. I had a lot of trouble with this step because my only available options were berkeley-visitor and berkeley-iot. But neither of these would work (both required a password, but iot Wi-Fi wouldn't work without the Mac Address and the visitor Wi-Fi didn't have a password that I could put in). I decided to set up my hotspot and by a miracle it actually worked (I've had a lot of hotspot issues). So yayyyy.

After that I followed the directions for finding the Mac Address of my P2. I will not reveal it...but it is a satisfying combination of numbers. >:)

I created a new device for my baby_worm under the Berkeley-IOT Wi-Fi using the Mac Address.

Then baby_worm was finally connected to the Berkeley-IOT network! Yayyyyyy!!!!!!!

#### Hello World

Oh...the classic. Every time I learn a new language or IDE I always do the "Hello World" script! I've never used Particle Web IDE but I've used in-browser IDEs that are very similar. I learned that the Particle Web IDE programming language is Arduino C. I know C# and Python, so I thought that it looked somewhat familiar.

Here it is running the Hello World print loop:

And here it is introducing itself as Baby Worm!:
