### Reflections

#### The Basics
This week, I started learning how to use Rhino and Grasshopper for the first time. My main goals were to learn the fundamental tools and vocabulary of the program, then to customize the Project 1 example files for my phone dimensions. If I had time, I wanted to prep the files for laser cutting and print for the next class.

First, I followed the [Rhino Tutorials]([https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/desinv-202/wiki/Rhino:-Training-links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V67fq8eCY8A&list=PLWIvZT_UEpWXp1ZYFiQ01w2nf4HApO09t&index=2)) linked on the course Wiki. This was extremely helpful because I realized that many of the terms and tools were simlar to other 3D modeling programs I have used in the past, like Maya and Blender. This helped simplify the concepts for me and made Rhino/Grasshopper seem less intimidating. I also watched the [Grasshopper Tutorials](https://vimeopro.com/rhino/grasshopper-getting-started-by-david-rutten) by David Rutten. (As a side note, Rutten's audio was very difficult to hear and understand, but the explanations were actually very good).

At the very end of this report, I will have a list of Rhino and Grasshopper "quick tips" that really helped me. I'm adding these as an easily searchable reference guide.

After reviewing these interface basics, I decided to try modifying the Project 1 Cell Phone Stand files.

#### Modifying the Cell Phone Stand Files

I worked in the CellPhoneStand_all Rhino file. There were a lot of different viewports and I couldn't figure out how to dock all of them (I only seemed to have a maximum of 4 viewports at once, so some were free-floating). I am a big fan of the Rhino Command line. It makes searching within Rhino sooo much easier than other programs. 

After opening up Grasshopper, I got to work modifying the Cell Phone Stand parameters. I was modifying them directly within the Grasshopper components instead of the Remote Control Panel, so next time I want to work within the Remote Control Panel since I imagine it's a lot faster. But starting with just panning around the many components and nodes of Grasshopper was really helpful since I could see how everything connected.

I measured the dimensions of my phone, a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G. I chose to measure my phone with the case still on, since that's how I use my phone every day.

I used a T-square to measure the dimensions in cm and then converted to mm. Due to the pop socket attached to the back of the phone case, the dimensions are likely slightly off.

Length: 165 mm
Width: 80 mm
Depth: 18 mm (with pop socket)
