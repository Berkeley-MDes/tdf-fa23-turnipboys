# Report #6 - Week of 10/5/2023

### Reflections

This weekly journal entry is now effectively my academic diary. 

Last week, we broke up into teams for Project 2 based on our preferences from the Google Form. My first pick was the long-distance chess game, but it seemed like no one else was very interested in that idea. :( To be honest, I wish I was on a team that was working more with game design elements since that's my comfort zone, but I think that it's good for me to break out of what is familiar.

I was assigned to the "CleanTech" team, which literally means technology used for cleaning (there were some misconceptions about this in the group). We started as a group of 6 and then divided into two groups of 3. After some larger group brainstorming, we came up with a few ideas and then decided to do some independent research on what was possible with our time and resources.

My smaller group agreed that we all wanted to experiment with something new and not worry as much about the final product. We liked the idea of a robot that would clean tabletop and other elevated surfaces for you (similar to a Roomba, but with the capability to avoid pushing objects off of the edge of counters and potentially cleaning under them instead). We also wanted to work more with textiles.

One of my group members, Christine, drew this concept sketch of "Wipey," a robot cloth that can clean under and around objects on your desk, tabletop, countertops, etc.

#### Weekend Break

Over the weekend, I visited Angel Island with some fellow MDes members. This wasn't directly related to school (thank goodness), but it was a really nice break from academics and gave me some mental space to be within nature. I also really enjoyed getting to know everyone on the hike a little better. :) I think that it's really important to have hobbies and activities outside of work and school because although I am still very busy and day-long hikes take a lot of planning, the change in pace and escape from technology is really nice. As much as I love my devices, I am on them way too much!! And most of my time at Berkeley is only spent within Jacobs and Wurster, so I've been trying to explore new areas where I can eat lunch and study.

#### Class Recap

On Monday, we had an interesting lecture from TJ and Jeff covering different use cases of the Photon microcontrollers as well as some approaches to designing our prototypes. I've used Processing before so I'm very interested in the audio visualization software that Jeff was using in his demonstration. I also thought that TJ's vending machine was very cool and liked seeing how they designed different pieces to suit the different animals and their snack rewards.

Otherwise, it was a fairly relaxed week. My group briefly met to discuss what we should focus on for our project specification.

### Speculations

After hearing about all of the different groups' ideas, I am more impressed than ever at the diverse capabilities of the Photon2 and other microcontrollers. I really like that the Photon2 has Wi-Fi connection. I honestly think that with the use of some simple cameras and pressure sensors we can create an interesting prototype and just have fun playing around with the textiles. 

I'm very new to these materials in these contexts, so I like thinking about how else they could be used. Adaptable clothing could be interesting. For example, cloth that can stretch or shrink with you, or maybe can adapt to provide heat or cooling within the material and the threading.

Also, unrelated, but I started using last.fm and I have been scrobbling my music like crazy. I love that word. Scrobble! We need more fun words for silly things. Scrobble scrobble scrobble.
